# SimpleDiet
Simpler than calorie counting, more useable than a strict diet plan.

This app is designed to aid in your dieting plans, without overcomplicating the whole process. Rather than tracking every individual calorie you intake, this app tracks that you are eating from every food group, and encourages you to make personal judgements about how unhealthy each meal is for you. it will then keep you on track to eat the correct amoumts from each food group, and to maintain a healthy diet.

 ### Food Group Tracking
 Simply choose which food groups are in the meal you are about to eat in their relative amounts, no need to get the exact values or to look up on the package or online how many calories are contained in the meal. The app will then track how much of each food group you are getting, and encourage you to have a varied diet with all the nutrients you need.
 
 ### Cheat Tracking
 After adding a meal, simply select how unhealthy you rate it on a scale of 0-3, the app will then track how unhealthy your diet has been over the weeks, and encourage you to make it healthier. By putting the onus on you to rate the healthiness of your meal, we encourage you to become more concsious of the food that you are eating.
 
 ### Drinks Tracking
 When adding a drink you mark down how many serves of water, milk, caffeine and alcohol is contained in it, then the app will track how much hydration you are getting, as well as your weekly intake of caffeine and alcohol.
